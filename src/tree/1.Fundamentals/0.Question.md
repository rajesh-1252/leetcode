1. **Tree Height & Depth**
   - How do you find the height of a binary tree?
   - How do you determine the depth of a given node in a tree?

2. **Tree Width & Diameter**
   - How do you find the width of a binary tree (maximum number of nodes at any level)?
   - How do you find the diameter (longest path between any two nodes) of a binary tree?

3. **Node Relations**
   - How do you check if a tree is balanced (height-balanced binary tree)?
   - How do you check if a tree is a full binary tree?
   - How do you check if a tree is a complete binary tree?

4. **Tree Traversals**
   - Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
   - Implement level-order traversal using a queue.
   - Implement zig-zag (spiral) level-order traversal.

5. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**
   - How do you find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree?
   - How do you find the LCA in a Binary Search Tree (BST)?

6. **Leaf Nodes & Internal Nodes**
   - How do you count the number of leaf nodes in a tree?
   - How do you count the number of internal nodes (non-leaf nodes)?

7. **Subtree & Structure Checks**
   - How do you check if two trees are structurally identical?
   - How do you check if one tree is a subtree of another?

8. **Serialization & Deserialization**
   - How do you serialize (convert a tree into a string) and deserialize (reconstruct a tree from a string) a binary tree?

9. **Mirror & Symmetry**
   - How do you check if a tree is symmetric?
   - How do you generate the mirror of a tree?

10. **Kth Element Problems**
